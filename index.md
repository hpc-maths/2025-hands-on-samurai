This training focuses on setting up numerical simulations using finite volume schemes with **samurai**. You will learn how to solve the Burgers equation and the Euler equations on adaptive meshes, leveraging **samurai**'s advanced features for solver integration and result analysis. Practical sessions will guide you through building and running complete simulations, dynamically adapting the mesh to meet physical requirements, and visualizing the obtained solutions.

By the end of this training, you will be able to:
- Implement finite volume schemes for conservation laws (Burgers, Euler) with **samurai**.
- Dynamically adapt the mesh using **samurai**'s adaptive mesh refinement capabilities.
- Integrate and configure numerical solvers within the **samurai** environment.
- Visualize and interpret simulation results.

Mini-presentations will illustrate concrete use cases in research or industrial projects, with feedback on using **samurai** for numerical simulation. At the end, an overview of the open-source implementations in **samurai** will be given, with particular focus on the two-phase flow models that have been developed.

Finally, the training will introduce **samurai**'s innovative data structure, which enables efficient management of adaptive meshes and facilitates the implementation of numerical methods.

Before the training, it is recommended to install **samurai** on your machine using the instructions available on the [samurai GitHub](https://github.com/hpc-maths/samurai?tab=readme-ov-file#from-conda). If you encounter any difficulties, please contact us.
